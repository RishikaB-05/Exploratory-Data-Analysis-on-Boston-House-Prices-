This is a brief  Data Analysis on Boston House Prices using Pandas.
I'm thrilled to share my latest data endeavor: Exploratory Data Analysis on Boston House Prices using Pandas! The Boston housing market is a dynamic and complex ecosystem influenced by a multitude of factors. In this analysis, we delve into the extensive Boston Housing Dataset to uncover insights, patterns, and trends that shed light on the dynamics of this market.

# üîçData Overview:

The dataset consists of 506 observations and 14 features. The features include factors such as per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, pupil-teacher ratio by town, and more. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

# Univariate Analysis: 
We examined the distribution of individual variables such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rates. Histograms, box plots, and density plots were utilized to visualize the distributions and identify any outliers or patterns.

# Bivariate Analysis:
We explored relationships between pairs of variables, focusing on their correlation with the target variable (median house value). Scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps were employed to identify linear and non-linear relationships between features and the target.

# üìàKey Findings:

The median house value exhibits a strong positive correlation with the average number of rooms per dwelling.
Areas with lower crime rates tend to have higher median house values.
There is a negative correlation between the pupil-teacher ratio and median house values, indicating that areas with more resources allocated to education tend to have higher property values.
